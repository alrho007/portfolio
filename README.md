# [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/husainridwan/movie-recommendation-system)

### Objectives:
Recommend movies based on properties of the movie selected.

### Description
This is a content-based movie recommendation system which recommends similar movies based on the properties of the selected movie.
Content-based methods are based on the similarity of movie attributes. Using this type of recommender system, if a user watches one movie, similar movies are recommended. For example, if a user watches a comedy movie starring Adam Sandler, the system will recommend them movies in the same genre or starring the same actor, or both. With this in mind, the input for building a content-based recommender system is movie attributes.
