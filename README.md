# [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/husainridwan/movie-recommendation-system)

### Objectives:
Recommend movies based on properties of the movie selected.

### Description
This is a content-based movie recommendation system which recommends similar movies based on the properties of the selected movie.
Content-based methods are based on the similarity of movie attributes. Using this type of recommender system, if a user watches one movie, similar movies are recommended. For example, if a user watches a comedy movie starring Adam Sandler, the system will recommend them movies in the same genre or starring the same actor, or both. With this in mind, the input for building a content-based recommender system is movie attributes.

### Introduction
This project describes the performance of active English Premier League players until the end of the 2019/2020 football season.
The dataset was extracted from www.fbref.com and www.premierleague.com to used to confirm the veracity of the statistics.
The data was then imported into Microsoft Excel and SQL for data wrangling(correcting inconsistent data types, filling missing values etc) and the refined
data was passed into Power BI to make visualizations for exploratory analysis. The data was separated into four different positions; goalkeepers, defenders,
midfielders and attackers to be able to notice correlations among statistics peculiar to each position.
